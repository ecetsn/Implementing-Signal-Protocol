## Introduction

The Secure Chat System is a project designed to provide a secure messaging environment. It involves Public Key Registration and message encryption to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of communications between clients.

## Features

- **Phase I: Public Key Registration**
  - Develop software for registering public keys securely.

- **Phase II: Receiving Messages**
  - Develop software for receiving encrypted messages from other clients.

- **Phase III: Communication and Status Control**
  - Develop software to enable secure communication with other clients. Status control is also implemented in this phase.
