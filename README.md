## Introduction

The Signal Protocol is a project designed to provide a secure messaging environment. It involves Public Key Registration and message encryption to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of communications between clients.

## Features

- **Phase I: Public Key Registration**
  - Develop software for registering public keys securely.

- **Phase II: Receiving Messages**
  - Develop software for receiving encrypted messages from other clients.

- **Phase III: Communication and Status Control**
  - Develop software to enable secure communication with other clients. Status control is also implemented in this phase.

> More detailed explanation is given in the pdf file, also note that Receiver.py coded for Phase-3 to enable messaging between students

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the Signal Protocol on your local machine.
